                <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s01_p02">When one looks at the health of our economy, it’s almost as if we are living in two different countries. The stock market is at an all-time high, and so are corporate profits. But these benefits are not being fairly shared. When I graduated from college, the average corporate CEO made 20 times what the average worker did; today, it’s nearly 400 times. In other words, it takes the average worker more than a year to make the money that his or her boss makes in one day. In short, the middle class of this country, our historic backbone and our best hope for a strong society in the future, is losing its place at the table. Our workers know this, through painful experience.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn15_020">Jim Webb, “Democratic Response of Senator Jim Webb to the President’s State of the Union Address,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 23, 2007, accessed June 9, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/washington/23webb-transcript.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/washington/23webb-transcript.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin</a>.</span></p>

                <li>What is the star system?</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">According to Senator Webb (and doing the math), when he was in college around 1966, a corporate CEO had to labor eighteen days to make the money the average worker earned in about a year. Now, CEOs only need a day to reach a worker’s yearly total.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s01_l02">
                        <li>What is vertical wealth imbalance?</li>
                        <li>In terms of the days a CEO must labor to net the average worker’s yearly pay, where does the star system line get drawn? Webb seems to think it’s somewhere between eighteen days and one day, but where would you draw the distinction? How would you justify your decision?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Webb says the “middle class of this country” is disappearing. How does this claim relate to the idea of horizontal wealth imbalances?</li>
                <li>When Webb asserts that the benefits of a healthy economy aren’t being “fairly shared,” he’s making an ethical claim, saying the wealth concentration is wrong. He was speaking on national TV and so didn’t have time to flesh things out, but how could an argument be formulated to support his claim?</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Jim Webb is a United States senator. When the United States was founded, there was about one senator for every twenty-five thousand people. Today, it’s one in three million. The salary of a US senator is $175,000; the salary of the average American worker is about $40,000.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s01_l03">
                        <li>Besides money, what kinds of compensation do you imagine Webb gets for his job?</li>
                        <li>Do you believe Webb’s compensation (salary plus other nonmonetary benefits) qualifies him as a star? Why or why not?</li>
                        <li>Does the fact that Webb represents more constituents than the original senators convert into a case that Webb’s salary should be higher relative to his constituents than the salary granted to senators two hundred years ago? Explain.</li>
                        <li>Make the case that Webb has an ethical responsibility to donate a significant part of his salary to public service causes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Part of the reason Webb’s talk lacked specifics was that, as a US senator, he doesn’t want to offend any particular person or large company. (He probably wants their money for his reelection campaign, or at least he doesn’t want them funding his opponent.) Others, however, who share his opinion about wage imbalances aren’t similarly constrained. One notable example comes from the web page <em class="emphasis">Daily Kos</em>, a politically oriented site with a huge readership and located on the left fringe of American politics, somewhere between rowdy and rabid. On that page, the following point was added to Webb’s speech:</p>

Just this week, Ford announced a staggering $12.7 billion loss, the highest in company history. This came after a year in which the company announced that it was cutting more than 40,000 jobs (30,000 of them union jobs). So what to do in a company that’s failed to deliver innovative products to the market, completely misjudged consumer trends, and managed itself into a fiscal bind? You award bonuses to the top management.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn15_021">Mark Sumner, “Jim Webb and Economic Reform,” <em class="emphasis">Daily Kos</em>, January 26, 2007, accessed June 9, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/1/26/295137/-Jim-Webb-and-Economic-Reform">http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/1/26/295137/-Jim-Webb-and-Economic-Reform</a>.</span></p>

The story follows Tony Montana as he enters the cocaine dealing business. His mentor tells him that to survive over the long term you’ve got to fly under the radar and stay small. Comfortably wealthy, yes, but wildly rich, no. Montana isn’t so sure. Later he decides the advice is directly bad, kills the mentor who gave it to him, and expands his business as far and as fast as he can. As moviegoers learn at the film’s end, the mentor was probably right.</p>

                        <li>Can you form an argument against the concentration of money in the hands of a very few people that would work equally well against Al Pacino’s (presumed) wealth and Tony Montana’s?</li>

Though he never made the <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em> list of the world’s most powerful and wealthy (unlike other traffickers from the same Mexican state of Sinaloa, including Joaquín Guzmán), there’s no doubt that Carrillo Fuentes got extraordinarily wealthy by bringing innovation to the cocaine business.</p>

If you need to get somewhere, consider riding your bike. Even though it’s 22 degrees right now (8:33 EST), this is not a crazy suggestion.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn15_027">“How to Commute By Bicycle, All of a Sudden,” <em class="emphasis">Days of Leisure</em> (blog), accessed June 9, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.daysofleisure.com/writing/How_to_commute_by_bicycle,_all_of_a_sudden.html">http://www.daysofleisure.com/writing/How_to_commute_by_bicycle,_ all_of_a_sudden.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s04_p02">When you need to preface a suggestion with the assurance that it’s not crazy, you can be pretty sure that the situation is bad.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s04_p03">The New York City transit strike began on December 20, 2005, and ran three days. Representing the subway operators, bus drivers, and some related personnel, there was the Transport Workers Union, Local 100 (TWU). On the other side, representing the city—and the traveling, tax-paying public—there was the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). Wages and retirement age were the main issues. The MTA argued (correctly) that the transit workers’ wages were much higher than the national norm, and their retirement age extremely low. The workers argued (correctly) that the job of driving in New York City was more stressful than in most other places. When negotiations failed, public transportation stopped a few days before Christmas, leaving millions of daily commuters stranded.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s04_p04">For some commuters, the bike became an option. In the abstract—sitting in a warm room reading about it—the possibility doesn’t sound so bad, get some good exercise and brisk fresh air on the way to work and back. There are real problems, though. The air can be dangerously cold and streets in winter are icy. It also needs to be remembered that the sun goes down early in December, so people biking home at night along the roadside are pedaling in the dark. Falls are common. Falls in front of oncoming cars are especially bad.</p>

                    <p class="para">The transit workers strike was actually illegal. After a similar walkout years before, the Taylor Law had been enacted; it barred transportation workers from leaving their posts and implemented arbitration methods for settling disputes. When the workers ignored the law, a judge hit them with fines and sentenced their leaders to short jail terms.</p>

                    <p class="para">The “last resort argument” justifying a workers strike is activated when three conditions are met: (1) There must be a just cause; (2) there must be proper authorization; and (3) the strike must be a last resort—that is, attempts to find solutions must’ve been fully explored.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s04_p05">In this case, the transport workers national union actually ordered the local to go back to work. The national union, in other words, didn’t authorize the strike, but the actual workers on the scene did. Does this count as <em class="emphasis">proper authorization</em>? In a union organization, who, ultimately, gets to decide whether a strike is appropriate, the organizing management selected to speak for the collective, or the individual workers on the ground?

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s05_p01">The early 1980s were seismic years in American business. Newly elected President Reagan promoted waves of deregulation legislation, and the openness loosed a breed of entrepreneurs bringing innovative goods and services to the marketplace so rapidly that entire segments of business life erupted in disorder. One especially affected area was transportation, and one very affected transporter was the venerable Greyhound bus lines. This report from San Jose State University summarizes:</p>

                <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s05_p02">Deregulation of the transportation industry made the competition for passengers stiff. New entrepreneurs who paid low wages entered the business and offered fare prices much lower than the more established inter-city lines. The newly deregulated airline industry made things even worse for Greyhound. Low-cost passenger airline carriers sprang up. People Express, for example, charged only $23 for a flight between New York City and Buffalo. Greyhound charged $41 for the trip. A flight by Southwest Airlines from San Francisco to Phoenix was only $60, compared to a Greyhound’s bus ticket to the same location costing $79.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn15_028">Herbert Oestreich, “The Great Greyhound Strikes,” Mineta Transportation Institute College of Business, San Jose State University, September 2001, 2001, accessed June 9, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.angelfire.com/al/silverball/strikes.html">http://www.angelfire.com/al/silverball/strikes.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s05_p04">To survive, Greyhound had to cut its prices, which meant cutting costs. The prices of buses and gasoline and similar were fairly fixed, leaving wages to be targeted. Greyhound went to the workers collective, the local Amalgamated Transit Union, and proposed a 9.5 percent wage cut.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch15_s06_s05_p05">The answer was no. Greyhound insisted. A strike ensued.</p>

They’d already recruited more than a thousand new hires in anticipation of the walkout, and agreed to pay them the salary the union had refused.

                    <p class="para">From the “Leave the Slave-Driving to Us” article: “After the strike got underway the Bus Lines tried to run scab buses. In response, the striking Greyhound workers carried out militant actions that were effective as far as they went. For example, pickets from Local 1225 in San Francisco, together with some supporters, tried to block the departure of buses from the 7th Street depot in downtown San Francisco. There was then a cop attack on the picket line and a melee ensued. Only one bus left the station. It soon experienced a collision with another vehicle (the driver of the other vehicle just happened to be a striking Greyhound driver) and it was forced to retreat to the S.F. depot.”</p>

                    <p class="para">From the “Leave the Slave-Driving to Us” article: “During any strike material pressures (rent or house payments, utility bills, RV financing, etc.) may influence strikers’ decisions. Since Greyhound is not merely a bus line, but a conglomerate with revenues from many lines of business, its capacity to bear losses from a strike is much greater than that of individual strikers to bear the loss of wages. Even those who have substantial savings may run short during a long strike. To succeed, they had to convince other transport workers and their unions to strike in sympathy with them. But of course, that’s illegal under existing contracts and laws. But that only means that the ranks needed to take matters into their own hands from the very beginning. The rank and file did not have to respect the law.”</p>
