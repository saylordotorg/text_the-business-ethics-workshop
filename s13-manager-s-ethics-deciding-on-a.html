        <h2 class="title editable block">I’m a Mac, and I’m a PC</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s01_p01">“I’m a Mac, and I’m a PC” is the first line from a set of advertisements produced for Apple.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_001">“‘Get a Mac’ Collection,” YouTube video, 9:39, posted by “Aploosh,” February 26, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siSHJfPWxs8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siSHJfPWxs8</a>.</span> Two guys stand in front of a white screen, a step or two apart. The one pretending to be an Apple Macintosh computer looks a lot like you’d expect the typical Apple computer user to look: casual, young, and cool; he’s not stressed but certainly alert and thoughtful. He hasn’t had a haircut in a while, but the situation isn’t out of control. He speaks up for himself without being aggressive. His t-shirt is clean, his jeans reliable, and his tennis shoes stylish. The PC, on the other hand, can’t relax in a polyester suit that’s a half size too small, especially for his inflated waistline. Bulky glasses slide down his greasy nose. Short, parted hair glues to his head. He’s clean, shaven, and very earnest. In one of the commercials, the PC man talks about the things he does well: calculation, spreadsheets, pie charts. The Mac responds that he feels more comfortable helping users make their own movies and organize their music collections.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s01_p02">Underneath these ads there are two very different corporate cultures, two very different <em class="emphasis">kinds</em> of companies making two very different products even though both sell their machines in the store’s computer section. Now, because this is advertising and it’s paid for by Apple, we should take the claims being made with a grain of salt. And, obviously, Apple didn’t air these spots because they wanted to exhibit their corporate culture. They wanted to sell computers (and hammer the competition in the process). None of that, however, changes the fact that the commercials do a good job of displaying what a difference between corporate cultures looks like. It looks like these two guys. They’re both capable and dedicated, but everything about each of them makes the other one squirm; it’s hard to imagine they could work well together because their habits and comportments—everything from how they dress to the way the talk—is so completely different.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s01_p03">The same can be said about workplaces. It’s easy to imagine a kind of office where PC fits nicely. People there would wear ties and skirts. They’d be punctual. Their days and working styles would be regimented and predictable. Employees would have their own cubicle offices, and anyone proposing an “informal Friday” break from the dress code would be looked on with suspicion. By contrast, Mac would function well in an open, warehouse-like space with a bike rack out front. Flextime would be common—that is, people arriving earlier or later in the morning depending on their preference and on the circumstances of their lives (whether they have children, when they can avoid rush-hour traffic). Regardless of when they show up, they take responsibility for making sure they log a full workday. The attire would be casual and diverse. Maybe the boss wears jeans. Some people would probably be annoying others with their loud music, but everyone would force smiles and be tolerant.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s01_p04">One of the reasons the Apple ad works well is that it resists the temptation to simply say Apple is superior. Yes, PC is dorky and Apple is cool, but Apple does admit that PC really is better at analytic-type activities like producing clean spreadsheets. The same mixed findings apply to corporate culture. At the PC office, the clothes aren’t nearly as comfortable as the ones you find at the Mac place, but at least there aren’t any guys wearing jeans that fall a little too low over their back end. And the flextime scheduling at Apple may make for a happier workforce, but only until it happens that a project suddenly arises and needs to be executed immediately, and one of the key participants has flex-timed and already left for the day. The other team members are left, that means, to do his share of the work. What about the bike racks outside? Everyone agrees that it’s great that the Mac people are peddling to work, but only until a morning thunderstorm pops up and no one can make it to the office. The point is there are advantages and drawbacks to every corporate culture. It’s hard to say that one is better than another (just like Macs work for some people while others prefer PCs), but it’s certainly true that there are different value systems beneath the distinct cultures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s01_p05">Anyone who has a management role in any organization will be expected to have a grip on what values guide the enterprise and how they reflect in the day-to-day life of people on the job. Further, some managers—and all entrepreneurs—will not only need to apply guiding values; they’ll have to select and create them.</p>

    <div class="section" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Definitions of Corporate Culture</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Corporate culture</a><span class="glossdef">The constellation of beliefs, customs, habits, and values determining how a business or organization acts in the world.</span></span> is easier to get intuitively than put into words. Because you can’t touch it, measure it, or take its picture (even though you can show two people in an advertisement who obviously <em class="emphasis">belong</em> to different corporate cultures), it’s not surprising that there’s no consensus definition attached to the term. Here are three attempts to put the idea in words. A corporate culture is</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>“the shared beliefs top managers have in a company about how they should manage themselves and other employees, and how they should conduct their business”;<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_002">“Can this Man Save Labor?” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, September 24, 2004, 84.</span>
</li>
            <li>“the pattern of shared values and beliefs that gives members of an institution meaning and provides them with rules for behavior in their organization”;<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_003">Robert Kuttner, “Labor and Management—Will They Ever Wise-Up?” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, May 9, 1994, 16.</span>
</li>
            <li>“a general constellation of beliefs, mores, customs, value systems and behavioral norms, and ways of doing business that are unique to each corporation, that set a pattern for corporate activities and actions, and that describe the implicit and emergent patterns of behavior and emotions characterizing life in the organization.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_004">Simon Head, “Inside the Leviathan,” <em class="emphasis">New York Review of Books</em>, December 16, 2004, 88.</span>
</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s02_p02">There are common threads to these cited definitions and some points that may be added:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s02_l02">
            <li>Corporate culture is <em class="emphasis">shared</em>; it’s not like a regulation or a code that’s imposed from some specific place outside the organization. The culture may begin that way, but once installed, it belongs to all those participating in the workplace.</li>
            <li>Corporate culture provides <em class="emphasis">guidance</em>. It’s not a potted plant to be looked at; corporate culture <em class="emphasis">tells</em> an employee that the Daffy Duck necktie is too far out there and should be left in the closet. The pumpkin necktie, however, is OK as long as we’re coming up on Halloween. Analogously, though more significantly, it tells a salesman whether it’s OK to flagrantly lie to a customer, to stretch the truth a little, or only to play it straight.</li>
            <li>Corporate culture provides <em class="emphasis">meaning</em> in the organization; it tells members why they are there. At Goldman Sachs, the bottom line really is the bottom line: people are there to make money. At Greenpeace, by contrast, people arrive in the morning to protect the planet, and while it’s true that many receive a paycheck for their efforts, that’s not the reason they show up for work.</li>
            <li>Corporate culture is top heavy; management carries the heaviest burden. Unlike simple office codes—such as turning in your expense reports within a week of terminating travel—that apply to people more or less uniformly, the burden of understanding and promulgating the organization’s culture falls heavily, though not exclusively, on the leaders.</li>
            <li>A corporate culture is a <em class="emphasis">constellation</em> of values, a set of ways of seeing the business world.</li>
            <li>The constellation of cultural values is <em class="emphasis">dynamic</em>; everyone involved every day stretches and pushes the organization’s culture.</li>
            <li>An organization’s culture is <em class="emphasis">organic</em>; it’s born and grows with the organization. It dies there too.</li>
            <li>The organization’s culture includes <em class="emphasis">life values</em>, ones that cross beyond purely business concerns to touch questions including, “Is it OK to date someone from work?” “Can I cry at my desk?” “Will anyone object if I have a shouting match with my wife from the telephone in my cubicle?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s02_p03">This list isn’t exhaustive. It does, however, show how thoroughly corporate culture penetrates the workday.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What’s My Organization’s Culture?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p01">Managers’ job responsibilities include protecting and promoting their organization’s culture. Fulfilling the responsibility requires determining exactly what culture lives in the workplace. There’s no secret decoding mechanism, but there are a number of indicating questions that may be asked. One of the most natural is to brainstorm associated words. For example, imagine visiting two offices, one filled with people who look like the Apple Mac from the commercial, and the other with those who’d fit naturally into the office where PCs are bought and used. Just looking at the commercial and jotting words as they flow might lead to lists beginning this way:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>On the Apple side: sloppy, fun, warm, loose, careless, resigned, informal, smart, creative, soft-spoken, controlled, cool, and haughty.</li>
            <li>On the PC side: uptight, formal, reliable, demanding, uncomfortable, determined, perfectionist, detail oriented, disciplined, unconcerned with appearances, and geeky.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p02">These are short, rapidly composed lists, but they’re developed enough to observe two profiles of work-life peeking out. You can see that that the Apple office is going to fit closely with values including comfort, innovation, and independence, while the PC office will be more compatible with values including reliability and responsibility. You can count on the PC office to get things done, but if you’re looking for something outside the box, you may be better off going the Apple route.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p03">Other questions getting at the heart of an organization’s culture and basic values include these dealing with the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">workplace time</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the way time is understood and valued in the workplace.</span></span>: How many hours are expected at work each week? Is there flextime? Is there telecommuting? Is there a punch clock or some other kind of employee time-in-the-office monitoring? Is it more important that the employee be present or that the work gets done? In some offices it’s the former; in others, the latter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p04">Then there are questions about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">employee interaction</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the way members relate to each other on the job.</span></span>. Is each worker situated in a private room or a more open, common space? Do people tend to compete with each other or is teamwork a higher value? To the extent there’s individual competition, how far does it go? Is it a good-natured jousting, or closer to hostile blood sport? Of course different kinds of organizations are going to recommend themselves to one side or the other of the spectrum. For example, a doctor’s office, an archeological dig, a construction company are relatively good places to value teamwork. A stockbroking office, a pro basketball team, and an actors’ studio are spots where you may want to encourage individuals to outdo those around them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p05">What’s the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">workplace mood</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the mood at work on a typical day.</span></span>? Fun? Somber? Energetic? Modern? Traditional? Many Volkswagen dealerships are remarkable for their huge windows and sunlight; it’s a kind of work environment for the sales staff meant to encourage an open, airy feel conducive to car buying. Elevated heating and cooling costs go along with all that glass, however, and different workplaces where money is valued more than ambience may choose to cut operating costs with a drabber space. Going beyond the architecture, different offices have different moods. It’s pretty rare that you see practical jokes or trash-basket basketball games going on at the dentist’s office. On the other hand, anyone who’s ever operated a call center telephone knows there’s a solid chunk of each workday dedicated to high jinks.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p06">Is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">workplace personalized</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the extent to which an organization’s members make their physical space at work their own space.</span></span>? Some office cubicles burst with family snapshots and personal memorabilia. Most assembly lines, on the other hand, are practically devoid of individual touches.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p07">Are employees <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">workers or people doing work</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the degree to which an organization’s members are valued as integral people with aspirations beyond those of the organization.</span></span>? If the former—if the value the organization attributes to those receiving paychecks is limited to what they do to earn the check—then few resources will be dedicated to supplementals and benefits. On the other side, a corporate culture valuing its employees as people may provide extra vacation time, health insurance, and retirement plans. Branching out further, you can get an idea of a workplace culture by checking to see if a gym or exercise room is provided. Day care for those with young children is another sign of the corporate culture that values workers as integral people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p08"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Dress codes</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, a set of rules—explicit or implicit—distinguishing what garments may and what may not be worn in the workplace.</span></span> reflect the organization’s values. Is uniformity or individuality more highly prized? If uniformity is the rule, what kind is it? In some advertising agencies, for example, the people who work in the creative department conceiving the commercials at first appear to be a diverse collection of independent-minded dressers, but get a few together and you’ll immediately perceive a uniform that’s as binding as the most traditional office—it’s just that ratty jeans replace slacks and clever t-shirts replace neckties.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p09">Another cultural indicator runs through the employees’ <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">leisure time</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the leisure time habits and preferences of an organization’s members.</span></span>. Where do people hang out? Do they go to football games, the opera, church? Do they spend their weekend mornings on family excursions because they have spouses and children, or are they still in bed, sleeping off the night before? More, is leisure time spent with coworkers? Do employees get together just because they enjoy each other’s company? If they do, the social outings are more likely to occur in connection with organizations seeking a harmonious workforce and expending resources to foster camaraderie on the job. They’re less likely to occur at organizations where everyone is fiercely competing with everyone else, as sometimes happens, for example, at stockbrokerages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p10">Healthy <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">community interaction</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the degree to which an organization and its members participate in local, nonwork endeavors.</span></span> is a value emphasized in some corporate cultures. Everyone has seen the “adopt a highway” signs indicating that a local firm or group has taken responsibility for keeping a stretch of highway litter-free. The professional sports leagues have traditionally asked players to dedicate some season and off-season time to community outreach. Other kinds of organizations, by contrast, may not even have a local community. Telecommuting and cloud computing mean employees can easily form a functioning organization with members living in different states, even different countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p11"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social cause activism</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the degree to which an organization and its members participate in social causes not directly related to work endeavors.</span></span> is another marker of corporate culture. The shoemaker TOMS Shoes fights rural poverty in developing nations by donating shoes. Other companies focus entirely on doing well in the for-profit marketplace.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p12"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Political action</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the degree to which an organization and its members participate in partisan political activities not directly related to work endeavors.</span></span> may (or may not) infuse a corporate culture. Many companies steer clear of overt or even hints of political partisanship for fear of alienating one or the other half of the electorate. This is especially true for larger enterprises spread across the entire country, drawing consumers from liberal corners of San Francisco, conservative bastions of north Dallas, and the libertarian towns of New Hampshire. Local businesses, however, especially those catering to relatively homogenous communities, may find no downside to flipping the switch on political activism and breeding partisanship as a guiding value. The company Manhattan Mini Storage provides (obviously) storage for household items in Manhattan. Their big competition comes from warehouses in New Jersey. The Manhattan Mini Storage billboard ads read, “If You Store Your Things in New Jersey, They May Come Back Republican.” This appeal may work pretty well in central New York City, but it won’t seem very funny most other places.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p13">Like politics, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">religious belief</a><span class="glossdef">As an aspect of organizational culture, the degree to which an organization and its members embody a faith not directly related to work endeavors.</span></span> and doctrine are rarely set at the center of the largest corporations, but smaller outfits operating in a narrow social context may well embody a particular faith.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s03_p14">Conclusion. Taken together, these categories of values begin shaping the particular culture defining an organization.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Is Organizational Culture Instilled?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s04_p01">A specific culture may be instilled in an organization through a set of published rules for employees to follow or by the example of leaders and employees already working inside the organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s04_p02">Instilling a culture through established rules typically means publishing an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">organizational code</a><span class="glossdef">A set of written rules defining an organizational culture and indicating how individuals ought to act within the organization.</span></span> governing behavior, expectations, and attitudes. The multinational firm Henkel—the company that invented laundry detergent and today produces many cleaning and health products sold under different brand names around the world—has published this kind of code. It’s quite long, but here’s an edited section:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s04_bl01">

        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s04_p05">This statement sounds good in general. The stubborn problem, however, with trying to capture a corporate culture with a string of dictates and definitions parallels the ones constantly faced in ethics when trying to make decisions by adhering to preestablished rules and duties: frequently, the specific situation is far more complicated than the written code’s clear application. So, in the case of Henkel, we learn that they <em class="emphasis">embrace change</em>, but does that mean employees can change the dress code by showing up for work in their pajamas? Does it mean managers should rank and yank: should they constantly fire the lowest-performing workers and replace them with fresh, young talent in order to keep turnover going in the office? There’s no way to answer those questions by just looking at the code. And that creates the threat of an at least perceived <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cultural dissonance</a><span class="glossdef">A conflict between the values the organization publicly promotes as essential to its functioning, and the values guiding an organization’s workers in their day-to-day activities.</span></span> within the organization—that is, a sense that what actually happens on the ground doesn’t jibe with the lofty principles supposedly controlling things from above.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="brusseau-ch09_s01_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Conditioning</h2>

<strong class="emphasis bold">The founder’s ethical legacy to the organization may contribute to its living culture.</strong> Walmart’s founder Sam Walton was a legend in austerity; he industriously minimized costs so in-store prices could be lowered correspondingly. This is a continuing aspect of Walmart’s cultural legacy, though it can be controversial on other fronts. Some complain that Walmart is in essence encouraging third world sweatshop labor by ruthlessly granting contracts to lowest-cost providers.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Stories and myths embedded in daily conversations may indicate culturally appropriate conduct.</strong> Warren Buffett, leader of the Berkshire Hathaway investment group is a kind of Yogi Berra of the finance world, a highly skilled professional with a knack for encapsulating pieces of wisdom. Here’s a paraphrase of one of Buffett’s thoughts, “I’m rich because I’ve always sold too early and bought too late.” Conservative investing, the lesson is, yields value for shareholders. It’s also a high ethical value within the corporate culture he tries to nurture.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">The dress, speech, and physical work setting may be arranged to cohere with the organization’s values.</strong> The United Nations threw a wrench into its own efforts to reduce global carbon emissions by scheduling its thirteenth annual global warming meeting in Bali. The weather was nice there, but since most participants came from the United States and Europe, it became difficult not to notice that the values of the organization’s handbook (control of carbon emissions) didn’t jibe with the values of the organization’s members (burn tons of jet fuel to work in a place with sunny beaches). On the other hand, the UN Foundation—which advocates reduced greenhouse gas emissions and similar—recently moved into an environmentally friendly building with cubicles formed from a biodegradable product and many similar, environmentally friendly features.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_007">“UN Foundation Green Building,” YouTube video, 2:23, posted by “unfoundation,” February 14, 2008, accessed May 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15_MdcSUlSY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15_MdcSUlSY</a>.</span>

Hiring presents a good example. Presumably, when an organization hires new employees, certain filters are constructed to reduce the applicant pool to those most likely to succeed. The process becomes self-selective, however, when job interviews are conducted as they are at Google. There, perspective employees are faced with bizarre questions that have nothing to do with the typical “Why do you want to work at Google?” and “Why would you excel at this job?” Instead, they get the following:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s01_p01">A frequently recurring business ethics question involves dishonesty: when, if ever, is it OK to lie, to stretch the truth, to not tell the whole truth? A simple scene of deceit goes like this: A fish dealer sells both expensive salmon caught in the wild and relatively cheap farmed salmon. Occasionally, he switches the farmed for the wild—a change that’s very difficult to detect through appearance or taste, even by expert chefs—and pockets the difference. Randy Hartnell is a fish dealer in New York who suspected that a lot of that kind of dishonest fish switching was going on among his competitors. He investigated and published an Internet report. As he tells it, he visited the famed Fulton Fish Market in lower Manhattan and found some dealers openly admitting that the fish they were selling as wild had actually come from a farm.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_008">Randy Hartnell, “N.Y. Times Calls Wild Salmon a Gamble for Consumers,” <em class="emphasis">VitalChoices</em> 2, no. 25 (April 22, 2005), accessed May 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imakenews.com/vitalchoiceseafood/e_article000389904.cfm">http://www.imakenews.com/vitalchoiceseafood/e_article000389904.cfm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s01_p02">This led the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> to do a follow-up story. Using sophisticated chemical tests, the <em class="emphasis">Times</em> confirmed that, yes, at six of eight places sampled, fish being sold as wild for about thirty dollars per pound was actually farmed salmon, which typically sells for about ten dollars a pound.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s01_p03">In the six bad cases, the person who actually made the switch participated in an organization where one or both of two things were true about the culture:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Profit was understood as being more important than honesty.</li>
            <li>Honesty was presumably important, but recalcitrant workers paid little attention and sacrificed the truth to make a buck.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s01_p04">These are two very different situations, and they lead to distinct discussions: One has to do with choices being made about what specific culture to instill in an organization. The other concerns <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compliance</a><span class="glossdef">In the business world, compliance measures the distance between what an organization says it believes in the abstract and what it and its members actually do.</span></span>, which, in the business world, measures the distance between what an organization <em class="emphasis">says</em> it believes and what its members actually do.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">An Ethically Questionable Corporate Culture</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s02_p01">The first situation—one where a fish seller puts profit above honesty because that’s just the way things are done in the company—is one which most outside observers would categorize as fundamentally corrupt. Everyone inside the operation knows what’s going on—principal and peripheral members are lying to bring in money—and newcomers are meant to pick up on and continue the practice. The organization itself is dishonest.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s02_p02">What responses are available? First, we need to check whether a serious attempt is being made, or there’s a real interest in making a serious attempt, to justify the deceitful actions. If there isn’t, if management and leaders of a fish-selling business aren’t interested in ethical debates, there’s not much ethical arguments can do about it. For those wishing to change a situation like this, the law (criminal and civil) presents good venues for action. Bad publicity in the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> might do the trick too.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s02_p03">If, on the other hand, there <em class="emphasis">is</em> an interest on the organization’s part in justifying their actions from an ethical viewpoint, we could ask, “Can institutionalized lying be justified and, if so, how?” Three possible answers run through three distinct ethical theories: duty theory, consequentialist-utilitarian theory, egoism:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Can basic duty theories justify putting profits above honesty? Probably not. Duty theories affirm that right and wrong is determined by a set of unchanging rules, and they typically include <em class="emphasis">don’t steal</em>, <em class="emphasis">don’t lie</em>, and similar. Because this kind of ethics <em class="emphasis">starts</em> from the proposition that dishonesty is wrong, it’s hard to see a nonfrivolous way of justifying the fish seller’s deceit.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Can a consequentialist-utilitarian theory justify putting profits above honesty? Utilitarian theory is oriented by the common welfare. Acts in business—whether it’s lying or doing anything else—are defined as acceptable or reproachable depending on whether they end up doing the most good for the most people. Any act, the theory affirms, that ultimately makes more people happier is good.</p>
                <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s02_p04">In this case, we can imagine an organization promoting lying as a common operating principal and making the case that the ethical stance is, in fact, good. Every Christmas, department stores deploy heavy men in red suits to proclaim that they live at the North Pole and ride a sleigh pulled by reindeer. The stores promote these fictions—addressed to innocent children, no less—to make money. Almost no one finds that ethically objectionable, however. One reason is that they’re implicitly accepting the affirmation that an act making people happier in the end is good, even if it’s dishonest. Similarly, the CIA covert operations branch (undercover spying, insofar as it truly exists) fits a utilitarian mold. In this organization, lying is good because it ultimately serves the American national interest and the basic principles of liberal democracies. Again here, the effects of what’s done matters more than what’s done. Finally, can this reasoning be applied to the lying fish seller? Maybe. As the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> story notes, the truth is that even the highest-level chefs and experts have a hard time distinguishing farmed from wild salmon. There is, therefore, a kind of placebo effect for food. If the fake stuff tastes just as good as the real thing, and the only real difference between selling one or the other is that the fish dealer makes out like a bandit, then an argument could be formed that the double-dealing does, in fact, increase happiness (the fish dealer’s) without hurting anyone else. Therefore, the dishonesty is ethically justifiable. In practical terms, however, it’s difficult to see how this strategy could get too far. Sooner or later someone <em class="emphasis">is</em> going to notice the difference, and as people begin to feel scammed (and therefore unhappy), the justification for the double-dealing crumbles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Can an ethical theory of egoism justify putting profits above honesty? Egoism is a coherent ethical approach to the world that does offer some justification for a deceitful fish trader. On this account, the ethical good for organizations and individuals in the economic world is defined as just whatever serves the organization’s or individual’s interest. And switching in the farmed stuff in for the wild is good for the fish sellers. (It’s hard to find any other explanation for the fact that, as the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> discovered, fully 75 percent of the places where fish was sold had some switching going on.) By definition, then, the dealing is ethically justifiable under this theory. Of course, most proponents of egoism in the business world don’t stop there. They go on to note that other, honest dealers who are pursuing <em class="emphasis">their</em> interests have a good reason to reveal the fraud. And, as it turns out, that’s just what honest dealer Randy Hartnell did, presumably helping his own business in the process.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s02_p05">Conclusion. Organizational cultures that incorporate lying as an acceptable part of day-to-day business do exist. Whether or not these cultures are ethically justifiable depends on the deep theoretical stances people adopt when going into business.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Ethics of Compliance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s03_p01">What happens when an organization’s principles are laudable, but they don’t get put into practice by the people actually doing the work? What happens, the question is, when an enterprise (say, a fish-selling operation) internally promotes basic values including honesty, but outside in the world where the transactions happen, the lesson is lost and individual sellers are swapping farmed for wild salmon?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s03_p02">In the business world, this is called a breakdown in compliance. Of course there are different reasons for compliance failure, everything from a bad-apple employee to a misunderstanding of directions, but the broadest explanation is simply that key elements of the organization’s guiding philosophy aren’t getting through to the members. One response to this possibility is a corporate culture ethics audit.</p>

Strings of questions can be answered simply yes/no or on a numerical scale from strongly agree (5) down to strongly disagree (0). These questionnaires can be distributed and the responses coming back summed and compared with previous samples in the same workplace or against results drawn from other workplaces. The goal is to get a sense of where people are at in terms of putting company ideals into practice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s02_s03_p04">It goes without saying that a simple questionnaire can, at best, provide only a crude picture of what’s actually going on inside an organization.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Scenes of Corporate Culture: Dress Codes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s01_p01">Corporate culture is visible on the big issues, including whether a fish-selling business is honest about what consumers are receiving. It also exists, however, in the customs and rules making up quotidian life in the workplace.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s01_p02">One of these quotidian scenes is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dress code</a><span class="glossdef">A set of rules—explicit or implicit—distinguishing what garments may and what may not be worn in the workplace.</span></span>, and a glimpse of how one can work comes from <em class="emphasis">AppleInsider</em>, a gossipy online magazine devoted to what’s going on—everything from life at work to product development—inside Apple. The site got its hands on a survey Apple ran of its employees, a version of a corporate culture audit. What Apple was trying to do was get a grip on the corporation’s values as the employees understood them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s01_p03">According to the study, one notable aspect of Apple culture is the leisurely dress code. “I never dressed nicer than sweat pants. I often came in wearing whatever I slept in the night before and walked around the office barefoot. Nobody cared,” said a customer solutions specialist who works for Apple in Austin, Texas.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_011">Kasper Jade and Katie Marshal, “Employees Offer Mixed Reactions to Corporate Life,” <em class="emphasis">AppleInsider</em>, March 30, 2005, accessed May 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/05/03/30/employees_offer_mixed_reactions_to_apple_corporate_life.html">http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/05/03/30/employees_offer_mixed_reactions_to_apple_corporate_life.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s01_p04">The survey presents this as one of the positives of working for Apple. On the other hand, there are people who go to bed at 3 a.m. after a rough party night and still wake up a full hour before leaving for work at 7:45 the next morning because no matter how tired they are, they wouldn’t be caught dead on the street without a shower, some makeup, and the rest. Now, what makes Apple’s culture appealing for many is that both kinds of people can fit in. If you want to dress nicely, great. If grunge is your style, still great. It sounds like this ethical stance in favor of individualism at the core of Apple Incorporated works well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s01_p05">Listen, though, to the next lines that the same pajama-clad employee wrote in the survey: “There were a lot of communications problems. Micro management to the extreme. I had six different supervisors that did not communicate together and gave me six different answers.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s01_p06">Well, if part of the corporate culture is to let people be independent to the extreme, dressing however they want, then it’s going to be hard to stop each individual supervisor from supervising in his or her own unique way. This is one of the profound truths about corporate culture: it’s difficult to have part way. If you’re going to raise the values of diversity and individuality, then that’s probably what you’re going to get across the board. If it’s in the way people dress, then it’s probably also in the management style and in the customer relations and in the way people treat each other at work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s01_p07">Of course no one is going to make the claim that a corporation allowing people to show up for work in pajamas is a scene of great ethical debate. It is, however, a scene of very broad debate. It shows how the values an organization decides to raise up permeate the company; they color everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Grooming Codes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s02_p01">Personal hygiene is less easily controlled by the organization than dress because it’s more intimate than clothes and, frequently, more difficult to define. It’s easy to require a necktie; it’s harder to figure out exactly what “well-groomed hair” is.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s02_p02">Some <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">grooming codes</a><span class="glossdef">A set of rules—explicit or implicit—concerning hygiene and presentation at work. Codes may concern hair, tattoos, fingernails, and similar.</span></span> aren’t questions of ethics so much as safety or hygiene. For safety reasons, you don’t want a guy who hasn’t had a haircut since the 1960s running the table saw in a lumberyard because his hair may get caught up in the blade with some Hollywood movie results. Similarly with respect to a woman working as a chef in a restaurant, if she refuses to wash her hands or cut her fingernails, the health safety of patrons eating the food she prepares is sufficiently concerning to allow and probably require that the cook be ordered to clean up or be fired.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s02_p03">While health and hygiene issues can normally be resolved by appeals to common reason, more difficult ethical dilemmas arise around the organization’s desire to maintain a uniform and presentable workforce as a way of boosting appeal to consumers. It’s safe to say that business would decline at a McDonald’s if employees were allowed to show up for work unbathed, unshaven, and wearing pajamas. On the other side, however, employees do have lives outside the nine to five, and workplace requirements concerning haircuts and beards obviously wash over to those personal hours.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s02_p04">The conflict between a business’s desire for grooming uniformity and the individuals’ personal freedom to appear in public as they wish centers the case of <em class="emphasis">Brown v. Roberts and Company</em> argued before the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 2008.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_012">Bobby T. Brown vs. F. L. Roberts &amp; Co., Inc., accessed May 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.socialaw.com/slip.htm?cid=18640&amp;sid=120">http://www.socialaw.com/slip.htm?cid=18640&amp;sid=120</a>.</span> The journey to a lawsuit began when the owner of a Jiffy Lube station hired a consultant to improve the business, and one recommendation was a grooming policy requiring neatly combed and trimmed hair, along with the prohibition of beards and mustaches. Consumers, the consultant reported, found that cleanliness and uniformity provided an implicit assurance of trustworthiness and good work. The problem for Jiffy Lube employee Bobby Brown was that he practiced a version of Rastafarianism. For more than a decade he’d faithfully subscribed to a religion that didn’t permit him to shave or cut his hair.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s02_p05">After refusing to abide by the new Jiffy Lube grooming guidelines, Brown was removed from his normal routine, which included working the register and greeting customers, and banished to the lower bay where, out of customer sightlines, he performed the dirty work of servicing cars and trucks. He sued to get his old duties back. The Jiffy Lube owner refused to back down. In court, the owner provided statistics showing that cleaning up the customer service personnel actually improved business, and, the owner added, he had the right to control the public image of his company regardless of whether it improved business or not. Brown countered that his grooming was protected by the fact that it was a religious necessity. The grooming requirement, he maintained, didn’t just interfere with his personal life and religion, it completely desecrated both of them. For its part, the high court punted the issue back down to a lower court.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s02_p06">The law in these cases may be hazy, but the ethics will come down to the foundational views shaping the organization’s working culture. Here are three different solutions to Brown versus Jiffy Lube as they emerge from three distinct organizational cultures:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>An authoritarian culture defines right and wrong inside a business as just what the highest-ranking individual orders. In this case, the owner is in charge of his shop, and if he determines that all employees must wear short hair, that’s the way the workplace will be. Since there’s no higher code, authority or appeal, people who want to be part of the company will need to accept obedience to the boss.</li>
            <li>A consequentialist, utilitarian outlook will produce a workplace culture that most highly values the collective welfare of all those involved. The issue is no longer boss versus employee; it’s what’s best for everyone. If this mentality controls the Jiffy Lube franchise, someone may propose that Brown bundle his hair up underneath a cap or agree to work only limited hours up front at times when visits from walk-ins and new clients are minimal. That way the business can prosper (possibly triggering wage increases for all employees), while Brown’s inconvenience is minimized.</li>
            <li>An ethics of care produces an organizational culture distinct from the previous two. Instead of seeing the workplace as controlled by an owner, and instead of seeing it as a scene of compromise in the name of the general welfare, a Jiffy Lube structured by care will conceive of the workforce as something near a family. In this case, the ethical justification for action will always trace back to the question about whether the act will strengthen and nurture the bonds of all those involved in working together. In the case of Jiffy Lube, this guideline will probably lead to a decision to allow Brown to return to his customary role. It may be that some business will be lost, but if that’s the cost of maintaining the harmony of the work unit <em class="emphasis">as</em> a unit, then the cost will be paid. Of course the owner may still appeal to Brown to cut his hair and shave, but just as members of a family learn to respect (or at least tolerate) the idiosyncrasies and uniqueness of each member, so too a business culture governed by care will ultimately be more interested in preserving Brown’s ties to the group than reforming his character, habits, and presentation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s03_s02_p07">Conclusion. Some businesses have an interest in controlling the way employees look. The degree to which they’ll control appearances depends on the ethical stance defining their internal values and culture.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing the Right Organizational Culture for Me</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_p01">For those starting a business, the first question about the values and culture of the new workplace is the simplest: <em class="emphasis">What should they be?</em> There’s no right or wrong answer, but there are different ways that any set of values may be justified.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_p02">Diverse fields of work will lend themselves more naturally to one or another organizational style and tone. A fish seller delivering to markets, restaurants, and homes, for example, one entrusted with providing food for others to sell and cook, will need to value punctuality and reliability. This kind of firm must honor its contracts by getting orders delivered to clients when promised and by making sure the quality (at least the quality that consumers perceive) is up to standard. Further, the physical workplace—which stretches from the office where orders are received to trucks delivering goods—will probably function best if the values of fairness, respect, and openness are enforced. The various individuals entrusted with any one account must be able to work together well and produce results individually that the entire group stands behind.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_p03">On the other hand, if the small company you’re forming happens to be a rock band, then creativity (as they say in the business world, the ability to think outside the box) steps forward as a cardinal value. When trying to get a nightclub or bar to book your group, you may lie about (or “exorbitantly exaggerate”) the response your songs have gotten from people who’ve listened to you in the garage. You may promise that you’ve got material to present a forty-five-minute show and run out after half an hour. You may not foster mutual respect in the workplace: the lead guitarist may secretly instruct the soundman to reduce the hapless bass player’s volume to near zero or the drummer may show up for work blind drunk and flinging expletives. All those failures in reliability and respect will wash away, though, if you’ve got a new sound and people like hearing it. Fish sellers and rock bands, finally, are different kinds of businesses and the organizational values surrounding them may be similarly divergent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_p04">Even within the same pursuit, even when two corporations are producing comparable products, there’s no requirement that their cultures be similar. In fact, that’s a central point of the “I’m a Mac, I’m a PC” advertising campaign. The appeal being made in these ads isn’t that Apple is better because their processors run a gigahertz faster than a PC’s or because the screen images are crisper or the battery life is longer. Fundamentally, Apple is making the case that the values—as displayed by the style of clothes the actors wear and their way of standing and speaking—are ones the purchaser may want to participate in. Apple, in essence, turns corporate culture into a selling point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_p05">Refocusing on the problem of determining a set of values for an organization, there’s a two-step process: decide the values, then justify them. One way to proceed is by posing some questions aimed at the core of workplace culture.</p>
        <div class="section" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">What Counts as Success?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p01">In some organizations (especially nonprofits and political groupings), success gets defined socially. Perhaps it’s an effort to eradicate homelessness, or diminish the effects of poverty, or advance a legislative agenda. In this kind of endeavor, one existing to serve the greater good, a utilitarian ethical perspective could be employed to justify the organization’s existence and goals. The <em class="emphasis">reason</em> for the organization’s existence fits well with the theory that acts are ethically good if they bring the greatest good to the greatest number.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p02">By contrast, if success for an organization is economic not social, if it’s about me getting rich and not the general welfare, other theoretical foundations may be more recommendable. A culturalist ethics—one that defines moral right and wrong as just what the larger society dictates—might work in this case, at least in the United States where private enterprise and the pursuit of wealth have customarily been regarded as a virtue. Alternatively, a rights-based theory, one that maximizes individuals’ liberty to pursue their own happiness (as long as the rights of others aren’t infringed upon in the process) may work well for those choosing to establish a corporate culture that raises profit as the main goal of the business.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Am I a Collectivist or an Individualist?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p01">If I believe that people work best when they work together, then I may choose to raise collectivism as a central virtue. Individuals are rated professionally in terms of their workgroup’s accomplishments. This kind of organization would recognize a single person’s accomplishment only when it served the efforts of others and individual rewards like bonuses and similar would be severely limited. By contrast, benefits received by one member like health insurance or a year-end bonus would likely be received by all. In the business world, finally, assembly-line work would be a good candidate for collectivism because any finished product is only as good as the weakest part.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p02">On the other hand, someone starting their own business may believe that individuals don’t work best when teaming up with colleagues but when competing against them. In this case, an individualistic corporate culture might be established with workers granted incentives to outperform their colleagues. Pay and benefits in this kind of organization would likely be closely linked to performance and success; those who do well for the company would receive a healthy percentage of the revenue they generate. Further, on the other side, employees shouldn’t make the mistake of thinking that just because the organization is doing well, <em class="emphasis">they’re</em> doing well. They’re not, at least not unless they can show how they contribute personally and significantly to the success. Finally, this orientation of values may be constructed by someone starting up a wholesale fish-selling operation, and hiring a sales force to go out and lure restaurants away from their current providers and give the new company a chance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">What Do I Value More, the Means or the Ends?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p01">One of the curious aspects of the farmed or wild salmon story is that for many (though definitely not all) consumers, there’s really no difference. Their palettes aren’t sufficiently trained, their cooking expertise insufficiently developed for the distinctions between the two kinds of fish to register inside their mouth. If that’s right, if a consumer really can’t distinguish farmed from wild salmon, then is there any harm in selling the farmed variety as wild (at a 200 percent markup)? Some people will answer <em class="emphasis">yes</em> and others <em class="emphasis">no</em>. If you’re on the <em class="emphasis">yes</em> side, if the kind of organization you want to set up will be ruled by what members do more than the results of what’s been done, then an ethics based on duties suggests itself as the right way to go. Within this kind of enterprise, the basic ideas of honesty and respect for others will prevail; they will guide the way people act inside the workplace and also the way the business interacts with customers. You can take people at their word inside this business because telling the truth is a basic element of the organization’s culture.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p02">On the other side, if you look at this and say, “well, consumers are just as happy either way, but selling the farmed fish as wild makes <em class="emphasis">me</em> a lot happier because my profit margin jumps,” then you’ll find a more comfortable spot on the consequentialist side of the ethical spectrum. Here, what people do is less important than the outcome. Decisions about whether an act is acceptable or not are answered by looking at the act’s consequences and nothing else. In this case—and assuming people really can’t tell the difference between the two fish—the way opens to affirming that the general welfare really is improved by the sleight of hand. The fish seller is better off, and no one else has grounds for complaining.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p03">This ethical dilemma—one between valuing the sincerity and the ethical protocol of the actual transaction, and one valuing just the end result and consumer satisfaction—plays out in many and diverse organizational environments. There’s the fish seller debating selling cheap product that tastes expensive. In 2004 Ashlee Simpson got caught lip-synching on <em class="emphasis">Saturday Night Live</em> when the soundtrack kicked in before she opened her mouth and Tom Petty’s 2008 Super Bowl halftime performance looked fishy. Does it really matter, though? In Simpson’s case, it obviously does because she got caught and it ruined her show, but if everything had fit together right, do you think it’s OK for her to pretend she’s live and then go to the tape without anyone noticing? Are people who paid money to see her sing getting cheated?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p04">One organization where this dilemma plays out in quite dramatic terms is police work. It’s an old-time policing phrase that more good has been done with the business end of a nightstick than through every courthouse in the land. It’s unclear whether that’s true, but it gets right to the heart of the question about means or ends. Should a police department be more focused on going by the book, treating all suspects as the written law dictates, or should they be more focused on the ends—that is, punishing criminals and minimizing crime in a community? Take a situation where an officer knows a man is guilty of a violent assault but the evidence isn’t there. Is it OK to plant something? As is the case of the fish seller and the stage performer, the basic values—the way the members have learned to live and act within organization—will dictate what ultimately happens.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">How Do I See My Employees?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p01">Many small businesses have only one employee: the owner who doubles as the employer. Others, however, require a workforce. If people need to be hired, the question about how they’re to be valued can’t be avoided. Are they paid mercenaries? Something closer to extended members of a family? Somewhere in between? One type of business where this question can rise quickly is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">franchise</a><span class="glossdef">A form of business where a company with a successful operation (called the franchisor) offers others (called franchisees) the opportunity to function under the franchisor’s trade name in exchange for a fee or similar compensation.</span></span>. In a franchise operation, a parent company sells the rights to a certain name and kind of product to an individual to start their own branch. Domino’s Pizza is a good example. Though there are corporate-owned stores, many of the local Domino’s are owned by their managers. These entrepreneurs agree to buy basic material from the mother business—the pizza dough and so on, as well as the signage and participation in advertising campaigns—and in exchange they’re allowed to command their own small outpost of the pizza empire. The extent of corporate control over particular franchises varies from one business to another, but since the actual owner is the person there from day-to-day and in charge of hiring and firing, the culture surrounding the place is going to be largely determined by the values the owner installs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p02">With respect to employees, what are the possibilities? A libertarian culture comes close to the mercenary system. Under this ethical umbrella, freedom and the individual pursuit of his or her own happiness become guiding values. Ethical good is defined as that freedom and pursuit, while reprobation is assigned to those acts interfering with others doing the same. In this case, the owner may (though not necessarily) adapt a somewhat disinterested attitude with respect to employees. A certain job is offered at a certain wage and the applicant is free to accept or decline. Acceptance means nothing more than assuming the responsibilities in exchange for a paycheck. Initiating a Domino’s Pizza business, of course, requires hiring many drivers to deliver the product. These aren’t great jobs, driving around and knocking on doors with pizzas, but they may work for students and others who need a little income. Neither the employer nor employee expects any loyalty from each other and the relation continues forward just as long as both benefit, nothing more.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p03">Alternatively, a franchise owner may want to welcome employees as integral parts of the business. An ethics of care suits this purpose. Within this theory, good is defined not as freedom or the pursuit of happiness but as the maintenance and fortifying of social networks and relationships. The workplace becomes paternalist (or maternalist) as workers begin seeing themselves participating in an organic unit. In this case, the owner is much less likely to fire workers who foul up (bring pizzas to the wrong address, incorrectly input customer orders into the computer), and probably more likely to share revenue and benefits with workers as much as possible. Drivers are likely to be trained at other tasks (making pizzas and taking orders being the main opportunities) so that they can participate more fully in the enterprise.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p04">The above questions posed and answered are only a beginning, only the first of many steps on the way to defining and implementing a corporate culture. It’s also true, however, that in the real world people don’t have time to sit down and extensively draw up every detail of their ethical business plan before commencing; every new manager will have to decide for him or herself how far to go on paper before actually beginning to run their operation, whether it’s a Domino’s Pizza franchise or something else. Many will probably just go ahead with the enterprise and pick up ethical things along the way. This isn’t necessarily a bad idea: it’s hard for anyone to know what they believe until they’ve experimented a bit. It is worth noting, however, that these kinds of decisions will have to be made at some point. Staying with the Domino’s example, every franchise has a few drivers who mess up more than the rest and every manager has to draw a line somewhere to mark the point where the driver is let go. When that happens, a decision about the values of the organization—the extent to which drivers are more like mercenaries or members of a big business family—will have to be made.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p05">Some further questions that a manager may ask to help sort out the organizational culture of the operation include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s04_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Who are my consumers?</strong> Are they purely a way for me to make money, or something closer to a social network with a financial element attached?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Am I a short or long termer?</strong> Do I see my business as a lifelong project, or is this a quick hit and then I’ll move on to something else?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Who am I responsible to?</strong> Am I doing this for me, my family, the community, the world?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What are the vital ingredients of success?</strong> Does my organization need to value analysis, competence, reliability, creativity, or something else to thrive?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What’s my organization’s relation with the law?</strong> Do I want to obey the letter and spirit of the law, just the letter, just the spirit, or do whatever I can get away with?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Am I a delegator or a micromanager?</strong> Will I give employees goals and let them find ways to accomplish them, or will I monitor their performance every step of the way?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s04_s01_s04_p06">Conclusion. If you’re starting your own business or joining up with friends to put something together, the first ethical questions you’re likely to face are those concerning the organizational culture of your enterprise. It’s true that you can put decisions off, but for most businesses at some point, there’ll need to be a coherent response.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_p02">Of course there are other ways of leading, and elements of these six models may be mixed in a single person, but taken together this group of strategies represents common ways of fostering specific values in the workplace. Two examples—John Buford and Carol Smith—illustrate how the strategies and values function together.</p>
        <div class="section" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">John Buford</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s01_p01">In a short video from the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>’s continuing “On Leadership” series, the story of John Buford at Gettysburg in 1863 is examined.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_014">“On Leadership at Gettysburg: ‘Find Those Confederate Forces,’” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> video, 4:40, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2010/04/21/VI2010042100960.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2010/04/21/VI2010042100960.html</a>.</span> Buford, a general in the Federal army leads a small force of cavalrymen on a mission to locate and engage Robert E. Lee’s Confederate forces. He finds them near Gettysburg and hatches a plan to arrange the coming battle on terrain that will favor the North. While his small group aligns itself on the high ground and begins battling the vastly superior Confederate force, Buford sends word to the main Federal army of his location and the advantage he’s holding. His group is nearly wiped out, but they resist just long enough for Federal reinforcements to flow in and occupy the adventitious ground. Days later, they’ll win the battle. The South never recovered.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s01_p02">Here are the episode’s key aspects according to the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>’s Ed Ruggero:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>As a cavalryman, Buford was accustomed to operating far from headquarters and direct oversight. He was empowered to and able to make his own decisions.</li>
                <li>No preconceived plan can account for all contingencies, so all overarching strategies must leave room for leaders on the ground to shift strategies as the situation requires and take rapid action.</li>
                <li>Buford asked for and got significant (life) sacrifices on the part of his soldiers in the name of the greater good and larger cause.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s01_p03">Along with Buford’s autonomy and decisiveness, the significant ethical trait leaping out of the organization he led was the uniform willingness of those working with him to sacrifice for the larger goal. There is, at the heart of this organization’s culture as it was fostered by Buford, a sense of the importance of the collective over the individual. Buford isn’t the kind of leader who seeks to maximize the individual initiative of the members of his organization and he doesn’t set his team loose into competition with each other. Instead, he fosters firm camaraderie. Within the six types of leadership personas laid out by Goleman, Buford is, not surprisingly, a <em class="emphasis">commanding leader</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s01_p04">Coming at this value from a different angle, Buford’s can be called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transformational leadership</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to transform the members of an organization into devoted and unselfish advocates of its goals.</span></span>. In his book <em class="emphasis">Business Ethics</em>, O. C. Ferrell defines this as the ability to transform the members of an organization into devoted and unselfish advocates of its goals. In a word, it means the ability to inspire.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_015">O. C. Ferrell, John Fraedrich, and Linda Ferrell, <em class="emphasis">Business Ethics</em>, 7th ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2008), 134.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s01_p05">As the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> video underlines, business isn’t war. Still, lessons in leadership—and the basic values animating one or another model—may be common to the two. So what kind of business might invite this commanding style? One possibility, one place that might do well under this model of leadership is a Domino’s Pizza franchise. First, because it’s a franchise outfit, because it’s an outpost of the central organization granted wide latitude and independence, the local manager and owner must be able to make decisions independently. There must be an ability to see a way forward and act even without approval from superiors. For example, all Domino’s locations share in the benefits of the central corporation’s advertising budget, but every individual manager is free to supplement those efforts. A franchisee may decide to send drivers to an apartment complex delivering discount coupons to every door or something similar. What’s important is that every neighborhood is different and offers unique opportunities. Success will require a leader who can get a sense of what might work at a particular place without constantly calling into corporation headquarters for guidance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s01_p06">Further, with respect to the employees, the commanding style of leadership may be suitable when you take into account that most drivers have relatively little experience in the pizza business and aren’t particularly motivated for the Domino’s team. Almost no one signs up to deliver food because they enjoy it or see a bright future in that line of work. Given that reality, a commanding style—leadership that demands employees follow directions carefully and one that values deference to the delivery policy and rules—may work to keep the operation flowing well. More, the values of transformational leadership—devotion to the organization and the unselfish advocacy of its goals—may function to rally the drivers, to inspire a belief in the cause of the business even if, as is obvious, winning the neighborhood pizza delivery war is far less dramatic and important than Gettysburg.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s02_p02">Referring these thoughts back to the list of six leadership personas, Smith reflects skills and practices of at least two distinct leadership styles: democratic and affiliative. Her custom of sitting in the middle of the table instead of stationing herself at the head isn’t an empty gesture, it’s part of the way she broadcasts openness to countersuggestions and input. Further, this kind of culture—one that values give-and-take and some sense of equality in the decision-making process—is bolstered by the distinction Smith draws between being a boss and being bossy. Being a boss means ultimately making, and taking responsibility for, decisions; being bossy means cowing people into grumbling obedience. It’s presenting herself as the former while resisting the latter that Smith believes makes her style work in her particular organization. Democratic leadership, finally, isn’t the same as political democracy; there’s no indication that Smith decides by taking a vote. But where the two do overlap is in the process preceding decisions: a high value is assigned to an open airing of differences, and to the insistence that all sides be heard and respected.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s02_p03">Smith also participates in an affiliative strategy for managing. When she invites potential new hires to dinner, she’s checking to see if they’ll add to the organization’s social harmony. Notice that Smith is probing for information about whether the new hire will mix with superiors, equals, <em class="emphasis">and</em> subordinates in the workplace. Every direction of social interaction is important. Of course the idea here isn’t that no work gets done because so much stress is placed on people getting along, it’s the opposite: because emotional integration is highly valued in the office, members of the organization are likely to work well together in pursuit of the organization’s goals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s02_p04">One way of summarizing Smith’s management strategy is that she’s a <em class="emphasis">negotiator</em>, always trying to find ways to get people to come together in agreement. She’s not so interested in locking her employees in a march toward her company’s goals; instead, she activates their participation and then balances individual efforts to keep everyone on the same page. This quality can be called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transactional leadership</a><span class="glossdef">Leadership dedicated to getting the members of an organization onboard through give and take, and inclusion.</span></span>, which means leadership dedicated to getting the members of an organization onboard through give-and-take and inclusion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_017">O. C. Ferrell, John Fraedrich, and Linda Ferrell, <em class="emphasis">Business Ethics</em>, 7th ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2008), 134.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s02_p05">Moving into a general business environment, what kind of business might invite the style of leadership Smith promotes? Starting with what can be excluded, a Domino’s franchise probably wouldn’t work very well. In that business, driver turnover is very high, so she’d spend inordinate amounts of time balancing the social dynamic of a workplace that changed personalities on a weekly basis. Also, input from drivers who consider their work to be a McJob and have no experience in the pizza business would be of limited value. It’s very possible, in other words, that the values Smith privileges would quickly lead a Domino’s Pizza restaurant—or any enterprise depending on a large, high-turnover workforce—into red ink.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s02_p06">Apple Incorporated, on the other hand might be a good fit for Smith. We know from the Apple employee survey that the workplace values tolerance and individualism. Within a social dynamic like that, one where people are free to work (and show up for work) as they wish, the great danger is a collapse of the group effort into individualistic, self-centered projects and agendas. It takes an alchemy of personalities to make sure these different types of people are functioning well together despite their explosively individualistic outlook. The value of social harmony as promoted by an affiliative leadership style, consequently, might be crucial for this kind of workplace. Apple also sounds like a place where democratic-type leadership could bear fruit. One of the great advantages of diversity in the office is a wealth of viewpoints. For the right kind of leader—one valuing and encouraging contributions from every direction—that diversity can be translated into a maximum number of options for action. Of course if the leader is weak, those divergences will result in chaos; the trick is to maintain openness to the input of others without sacrificing authority and surrendering to rampant individualism.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="brusseau-ch09_s05_s01_s02_p07">Conclusion. No one style of leadership will work in every situation, and very few individuals will find that they naturally fall into one category or another. But a sense of the range of possibilities, and an ability to understand the different values holding them up, maximizes a leader’s chances for success.</p>

                    <p class="para">A contributor named creditderivatives posts this about the culture at Deutsche Bank Equities: “These guys were brilliant and no-nonsense. Very tolerant atmosphere, but very focused. These guys argued over the correct pricing approach for equity swaps as opposed to which March Madness bound team had the best chance of winning it all.”</p>

                        <li>One important characteristic of corporate culture is employee interaction: the way workers relate to each other on the job. At Deutsche Bank, does it sound like the culture values teamwork among workers, competition, or some mix? Explain.</li>

                        <li>The two basic ways that an organizational culture is instilled are codes (established rules guiding an organization’s members) and social conditioning (guidance is provided by following the cues and examples of others in the organization).

They put on everything from massive aquariums to Dollywood, the Dolly Parton theme park in Tennessee.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s02_p02">In an interview, Manby discusses the corporate culture infusing the properties. It’s composed of eight attributes:</p>

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s02_p03">Manby exemplifies the corporate values he’s trying to instill this way, “You can dislike somebody, but you can still respect them, forgive them, and treat them with humility and honesty. We also have a phrase: ‘admonish in private, praise in public.’ So you don’t embarrass people.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s02_p04">Manby explains that 50 percent of a Herschend executive’s year-end bonus is awarded on the basis of how well the organization’s culture is exhibited and promoted. As he puts it, “You have to put your money where your mouth is.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s02_p05">He concludes with this: “It’s all about hiring the right people. You know, this culture either resonates with people or it doesn’t.

According to him, “I don’t want to bash GM, but intimidation was part of the culture there. You would get ridiculed in meetings. The CEOs had big egos and had no problem making you look silly. I once missed one of my numbers. I didn’t miss it by that much, but the president of all of Saab calls me and orders me to fly over there [to Europe]. I get there Monday morning, he chews me out for four hours, and then I get on a plane and fly back. It was so humiliating, so uncalled for. I figured, if that’s the way I’m going to be treated, I don’t need that. That’s when I began looking at other opportunities.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_020">Steve Tobak, Undercover Boss: Escaping GM’s Abusive Corporate Culture,” <em class="emphasis">The Corner Office</em> (blog), <em class="emphasis">BNET</em>, March 30, 2010, accessed May 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/ceo/?p=4254">http://blogs.bnet.com/ceo/?p=4254</a>, brackets in the original.</span></p>

The point being made is that people can end up paying full price for a copy.

                        <li>One reason to lie to the people you hire to sell the bags elsewhere is to help them do their job well.

Take the case of Carmen D’Alessio. “I created Studio 54!” she proclaims, even though she didn’t own any part of the club or have any official role in the way it was run. Still, according to her, if you want to find out about the once-thriving business, “I’m the most important person to talk to.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_022">Jada Yuan, “As the Disco Ball Turns,” <em class="emphasis">New York</em>, April 30, 2007, accessed May 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://nymag.com/news/features/31277">http://nymag.com/news/features/31277</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s04_p02">In the 1980s, Studio 54 was <em class="emphasis">the</em> New York City club. It began, according to D’Alessio, soon after she dined with two men—Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell—who owned a club in Queens, New York, an area not considered particularly trendy. She thought that Rubell possibly had some raw night-clubbing talent, so she encouraged him to bring his skills to hipper Manhattan.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s04_p03">To generate buzz before Studio 54 actually opened, she dressed Schrager and Rubell in Armani suits and threw a dinner in their honor attended by celebrated artist Andy Warhol, clothing designers Halston and Calvin Klein, and a host of similarly bright luminaries. Then, on the club’s first night, they went for an outlandish theme bash: 1001 Nights with elephants, camels, tents, men wearing turbans, belly dancers, and everything else packed onto the disco floor. Soon after the remarkable event, a widely distributed magazine at the time, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, put Studio 54 on their cover.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s04_p04">The parties D’Alessio threw were as outrageous and scandalous as the guests who turned up. One night Bianca Jagger (ex of Mick) rode in on a white horse; on another the designer Valentino got to act as the ringleader of real circus animals. Armani was feted with a drag-queen ballet. The bartenders were young, male, built, and shirtless. The busboys doubled as entertainers: dressed in tight little white shorts, bowties, and nothing else, they were given illicit drugs and a small paycheck and told to pick up glasses and party with the guests, who included fashion designers, artists, and unique people like Johannes von Thurn und Taxis, a flaming and wealthy European aristocrat whose wife was thirty years younger and so explosive that people called her Princess TNT. Malcolm Forbes, the hard-nosed American businessman, was a regular too. Everyone was welcome, as long as they were interesting.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s04_p05">In talking about it now, Carmen D’Alessio gives credit to the others, but never lets anyone forget what Andy Warhol said about Studio 54’s more visible leaders, Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell: “Carmen brought, hand in hand, Ian and Steve to the Big Apple.”</p>

                    <p class="para">The line outside Studio 54 was infamous. People stretched around the block and waited hours to get in. Some waited all night and never reached the door. One reason things went so slowly for many is that D’Alessio enjoyed swooping out of the club, running down the line, and hand picking people to jump ahead and go straight in.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s04_l02">
                        <li>Andy Warhol said this about D’Alessio: “She has gone everywhere from Rome to Rio. Anywhere there is a party and until the party lasts, she’ll be there, because she has a list of the rich, the beautiful and the young.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn09_023">Steve Lewis, “Good Night Mr. Lewis: Carmen D’Alessio’s Fabulous Life,” blackbookmag.com, December 11, 2008, accessed May 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/good-night-mr-lewis-carmen-dalessios-fabulous-life-part-two/5463">http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/good-night-mr-lewis-carmen-dalessios-fabulous-life-part-two/5463</a>.</span> Can you make a good guess about the kind of people that D’Alessio chose for quick entry?</li>
                        <li>Essentially, D’Alessio chose some clients for better service than others. Justify this management strategy ethically.</li>
                        <li>Another entertainment company with lines is Herschend, the parent corporation of many Disneyland-like theme parks around the country. The lines there—waiting to get on the roller coaster, to buy popcorn, to go to the bathroom—are first come, first served. The values Herschend uses to define its culture (patience, kindness, honesty, humility, respectfulness, selflessness, forgiveness, commitment) fit well with the egalitarian treatment. If you were in charge at Studio 54, what kind of values could you array to help employees and others understand why the line outside the bar moved so unevenly?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Studio 54 was a big-time vice den. Upstairs in the shadowy balcony people regularly coupled. Drugs were as common as beer. (A large glittery moon with a face and arms hung from the ceiling. It was snorting cocaine.) Management knew about all this and encouraged it.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s04_l03">
                        <li>With a focus on the facts that D’Alessio and company generally hired young, attractive, and muscular men, asked them to work with almost no clothes, and fed them drugs to brighten their attitudes, how would you characterize management’s culture with respect to employees? Were they valued as mercenaries, as something closer to members of a family, as something else? (Remember, guys lined up to apply for these coveted posts.)</li>
                        <li>How would you describe the Studio 54 attitude toward its consumers? Were they valued as people to be fleeced of their money, as participants in a shared project? Something else? Why do you think that?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Though not a lot of clothing was worn by frontline employees, this doesn’t change the fact that there was a very strict dress code at Studio 54.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch09_s06_s04_l04">
                        <li>In ethical terms, is there any difference between requiring guys to wear almost nothing while they hustle around the bar delivering drinks and, in a different business, requiring guys to wear neat, stiff uniforms while they hustle around a neighborhood delivering Domino’s pizzas? If there is a difference, what is it? If not, why not?</li>
                        <li>Unlike Domino’s, Studio 54 had a semiofficial body requirement for employees: the guys needed to be beefy and fit. In thinking about the management decision to impose both dress codes and body requirements, how are these two demands similar and how are they different? Is one less ethically problematic than another? Why or why not?</li>
                        <li>What are some ethical justifications an owner could cite for enforcing a dress code in general, regardless of whether it’s a near-nude barboy or a Domino’s driver? How would those arguments apply in the specific case of Studio 54?</li>

                    <p class="para">Carmen D’Alessio was behind the scenes at Studio 54, throwing the parties, arranging people, setting the tone of the place. With respect to Daniel Goleman’s six basic leadership personas listed below, which ones do you suspect correspond with D’Alessio, and which don’t fit her so well? Why?</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="para">Part of the reason for naming a leadership style a <em class="emphasis">leadership persona</em> is to underline the idea that being a leader can be like donning a mask: you can be whatever you choose when you stand in front of others and direct. Besides being a leader at Studio 54, D’Alessio was also a massive partier. How is adopting a personality for leading an organization like adopting a style to exhibit when you go out with friends on the weekend?</p>
