            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s01_p01">Some people argue that there’s no ethical requirement to protect the environment because the natural world has no intrinsic value. Against that ethical posture, here are four broad justifications for environmental protection. Each begins with a distinct and fundamental evaluation:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s01_l01">
                <li>The environment should be protected in the name of serving human welfare, which is intrinsically valuable.</li>
                <li>The environment should be protected in the name of serving future generations because they’re valuable and merit intergenerational fairness.</li>
                <li>The environment should be protected to serve animal welfare because there’s an independent value in the existence and lives of animals.</li>
                <li>The entire environmental web should be protected for its own sake because the planet’s collection of ecosystems is intrinsically valuable.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s01_p02">On a Yahoo! forum page, a student named redbeard_90 posts the question “why should we save the planet?” and partially explains this way: “With all the constant talk of ‘saving the planet’ and stopping global warming, should we actually try to stop it?

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s02_p01">Fifty years ago airports were designed to reward fliers with architecture as striking as the new experience of flight was rare and exciting. From those early days, only a few airports remain unspoiled by renovation and expansion. The Long Beach Airport south of Los Angeles is a survivor. The low lines of midcentury modern architecture captivate today’s visitors just as they did the first ones. The restaurant overlooking the tarmac remains as elegant and perfectly simple as always. Walking the concourse, it’s easy to imagine men in ties and women and children in their Sunday clothes waiting for a plane while uniformed porters manage their suitcases.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s02_p02">Flying is different today—no longer exciting and rare, it’s just frustrating and crowded. Recognizing that reality, when the large European nations combined to form an airplane manufacturer, they didn’t choose a distinguished and elevated name for their enterprise, they just called it Airbus: a company that makes buses that happen to go up and down.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s02_p03">Airplanes are tremendously polluting. In the United States, large passenger flights account for about 3 percent of released greenhouse gasses. That doesn’t sound like much, but when you compare the number of flights with car trips, it’s clear that each airplane is billowing massive carbon dioxide. And the problem is only getting worse, at least on the tourism front. Over the course of the next decade, global tourism will double to about 1.6 billion people annually.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s02_p04">Tourists aren’t the only fliers. Planes are also taken by people heading to other cities to talk about tourism. One of them, Achim Steiner, is the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program. At a recent conference in Spain, he said, “Tourism is an extraordinary growth industry, it’s the responsibility of operators—from hoteliers to travel companies—as well as governments to ensure that sites are sustainable.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn14_021">James Kanter, “How Do You Measure Green Tourism?,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 6, 2008, accessed June 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/is-there-any-such-thing-as-green-tourism">http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/is-there-any-such-thing-as-green-tourism</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s02_p05">Sustainability has at least two sides. On one side, there’s the economic reality: revenue provided by visitors pays for needed services. An example comes from the Masai Mara park reserve in Kenya. In villages surrounding the park, schools were forced to close when political unrest scared away the tourists and their money. On the other side, sustainability also means environmental protection. According to Steiner, there’s the possibility that “Masai Mara could be overused to the point where it loses its value.”</p>

                    <p class="para">Fifty years ago, airplanes contributed almost no pollution to the environment because so few could afford to fly. One way to limit the amount of pollution into the air is through incentives. In the airplane case, a large tax could be attached to an airline ticket, thus providing an incentive to tourists to stay home or use alternate sources of transportation. Of course, for the very wealthy, the tax will be more absorbable and, presumably, airplane travel would tend toward its origins: flying would be something the rich do.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s02_p07">How could a utilitarian analysis be used to justify the action of, in essence, reserving plane flying for the rich in the name of helping the environment?</p>

                    <p class="para">The airport at Long Beach is a low-ranking historical treasure. Tourists will never flock to see it, but it does incarnate and vivify a time in the recent past.

                        <li>Is preserving the natural world like the preservation of a historical architectural treasure? If so, why? If not, why not?</li>
                        <li>Using standard arguments against the business responsibility to preserve the natural world (free use, domination and progress, geological time), make the case that progress should be allowed to destroy the Long Beach Airport’s historical authenticity if that course of action is profitable.</li>
                        <li>Using standard arguments in favor of the business responsibility to preserve the natural world (preservation for human welfare, for future generations, for the sake of the thing itself), make the case that the Long Beach Airport should be preserved.</li>

With tubes burrowing down in the earth and shooting up high into the air, they’re wired to pump air from below and jet it above. The idea is to disperse toxic vapors rising up through the ground. The vapor’s source is industrial solvents poured down drains and dripped out of leaky pipes at the local IBM factory over the course of its seventy-five-year history.</p>

The IBM of today leaves most hard manufacturing to foreign firms in low-cost countries. What IBM now wants to do now, according to their advertising, is “build a smarter planet.” That means solving problems like this one reported by CNN:</p>

                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s03_p05">The solution? Swede governmental officers decided on a congestion fee, on charging vehicles money for entering the city at peak traffic times. The aim was to seriously reduce the number of cars downtown at rush hours. That’s easier said than done, however. Stopping people at toll booths would just make the problem worse: it would add yet another air-polluting stop to the traffic through town. So IBM was hired to produce camera technology allowing license plate numbers to be recorded and recognized automatically. Then monthly bills were generated and mailed out to the car owners. As CNN reported, these were the results:</p>

                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch14_s05_s03_p06">Traffic fell 35 percent almost immediately and stayed down 22 percent—and not just at peak times or solely downtown. Emissions also dropped by 14 percent. The streets became more pedestrian friendly, and the buses began finishing their routes so quickly that the city had to rewrite the schedules. The fee schedule makes it obvious when traffic will be the worst, so drivers who trek in during peak hours know they’ll pay more for what will probably be a maddening experience. As a result, people seem to be cutting out unnecessary trips: bundling afterschool pickups, say, with visits to the grocery store. In short, Swedes are driving smarter.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn14_026">Jeffrey M.
