            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s01_p01">Earl Grinols and David Mustard are economists and, like a lot of people, intrigued by both casinos and crime. In their case, they were especially curious about whether the first causes the second. It does, according to their study. Eight percent of crime occurring in counties that have casinos results from the legalized gambling. In strictly financial terms—which are the ones they’re comfortable with as economists—the cost of casino-caused crime is about $65 per adult per year in those counties.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn13_005">Earl Grinols and David Mustard, “Measuring Industry Externalities: The Curious Case of Casinos and Crime,” accessed June 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://casinofacts.org/casinodocs/Grinols-Mustard-Casinos_And_Crime.pdf">http://casinofacts.org/casinodocs/Grinols-Mustard-Casinos_And_Crime.pdf</a>.</span></p>

She coasts out to the street and drops her purse in front of an out-of-towner. When the chivalrous guy bends over to pick it up for her, she picks his back pocket. With the $100 stolen from the wallet, she heads back into the casino, spends $40 on hard liquor, loses the rest at the roulette table, and goes home. She wakes up alone, though some underwear she finds on her floor makes her think she probably didn’t start the night that way. She can’t remember.</p>

                        <li>Say that the casino under discussion in this set of questions is the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, which is owned by a large, public corporation. You have five shares of stock inherited a few years ago when a relative died. You are legally protected from liability claims.

                    <p class="para">Pigouvian taxes (named after economist Arthur Pigou, a pioneer in the theory of externalities) attempts to correct externalities—and so formalize a corporate social responsibility—by levying a tax equal to the costs of the externality to society. The casino, in other words, that causes crime and other problems costing society, say, $1 million should pay a $1 million tax.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s01_l07">
                        <li>In terms of casinos, would such a tax more or less satisfy any ethical claim that could be made against them for the social problems they cause? Why or why not?</li>
                        <li>The way these social scientists measured the cost of each crime was, more or less, by totaling the <em class="emphasis">quantifiable</em> costs—that is, those things that could receive a price tag fairly readily. If, for example, your car gets stolen and sold for parts by a desperate gambler, you can put a price on the crime’s cost by checking the car’s Kelly Blue Book value. Added to that there are administrative costs—at the police station, the insurance company—and those too may be figured in terms of time and wages. Still, quite a bit of the cost of crime escapes (as the authors readily admit) their measure. Their calculations don’t include lost productivity, social service, and welfare costs. They also don’t include emotional costs, the tears, and distress of the victim. Is there any way for those costs—especially the emotional suffering—to be put into dollars and cents? If so, how? If not, is there some other kind of requirement that could be strapped onto casinos to help make them socially responsible for their activities?</li>

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s02_p01">The W. R. Grace Company was founded by, yes, a man named W. R. Grace. He was Irish and it was a shipping enterprise he brought to New York in 1865. Energetic and ambitious, while his company grew on one side, he was getting civically involved on the other. Fifteen years after arriving, he was elected Mayor of New York City. Five years after that, he personally accepted a gift from a delegation representing the people of France. It was the Statue of Liberty.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s02_p02">Grace was a legendary philanthropist. He provided massive food donations to his native Ireland to relieve famine. At home, his attention focused on his nonprofit Grace Institute, a tuition-free school for poor immigrant women. The classes offered there taught basic skills—stenography, typewriting, bookkeeping—that helped students enter the workforce. More than one hundred thousand young women have passed through the school, which survives to this day.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s02_p03">In 1945, grandson J. Peter Grace took control of the now worldwide shipping company. A decade later, it became a publicly traded corporation on the New York Stock Exchange. The business began shifting from shipping to chemical production.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s02_p04">By the 1980s, W. R. Grace had become a chemical and materials company, and it had come to light that one of its plants had been pouring toxins into the soil and water underneath the small town of Woburn, Massachusetts. The poisons worked their way into the town’s water supply and then into the townspeople. It caused leukemia in newborns. Lawsuits in civil court, and later investigations by the Environmental Protection Agency, cost the corporation millions.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s02_p05">J. Peter Grace retired as CEO in 1992. After forty-eight years on the job, he’d become the longest-reigning CEO in the history of public companies. During that time, he also served as president of the Grace Institute.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s02_p06">The nonfiction novel <em class="emphasis">A Civil Action</em> came out in 1996. The best-selling, award-winning chronicle of the Woburn disaster soon became a Hollywood movie. The movie, starring John Travolta, continues to appear on television with some regularity.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s02_p07">To honor the Grace Institute, October 28 was designated “Grace Day” by New York City in 2009. On that day, the institute defined its mission this way: “In the tradition of its founding family, Grace Institute is dedicated to the development of the personal and business skills necessary for self-sufficiency, employability, and an improved quality of life.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn13_006">“Our Mission,” Grace Institute, accessed June 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.graceinstitute.org/mission.asp">http://www.graceinstitute.org/mission.asp</a>.</span></p>

                        <li>The Grace Institute—the people employed there and the women receiving free training—depend to some extent on the chemical company being profitable.

                </li>
                <li>As this question is being written, the share price of W. R. Grace is $26.17, and there are a total of 72,780,100 shares out there in the world. You’ve saved some money from a summer job and invested in Grace, 100 shares to be exact. That costs you $2,617, and means you own a not-overwhelming 0.000137 percent of the company. Next, you e-mail this to the CEO: “I worked hard for my $2,617, I bought stock to see that amount rise, and I want you to pour a little bit more of the profits into research and development of new products, and a little less into the Grace Institute.” Assuming the CEO is a proponent of stakeholder ethics, what do you suppose the response would be?</li>

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s03_p01">The Body Shop is a cosmetics firm out of England, founded by Anita Roddick. “If business,” she writes on the company’s web page, “comes with no moral sympathy or honorable code of behaviors, then God help us all.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn13_007">“Our Values,” The Body Shop, accessed June 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.thebodyshop.com/_en/_ww/services/aboutus_values.aspx">http://www.thebodyshop.com/_en/_ww/services/aboutus_values.aspx</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s03_p02">Moral sympathy and an honorable code of behaviors has certainly helped The Body Shop. Constantly promoted as an essential aspect of the company and a reason to buy its products, the concept of corporate social responsibility has been a significant factor in the conversion of a single small store in England to a multinational conglomerate.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s03_p03">Maybe it has been <em class="emphasis">too</em> significant a factor. That’s certainly the suspicion of many corporate watchers. The suspicion isn’t that the actual social responsibility has been too significant but that the actions of corporate responsibility have been much less energetic than their promotion. The social responsibility has been, more than anything else, a marketing strategy. Called <em class="emphasis">greenwashing</em>, the accusation is that only minimally responsible actions have been taken by The Body Shop, just enough to get some good video and mount a loud advertising campaign touting the efforts.

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p01">It’s probably the most repeated business ethics line in recent history. Michael Douglas—playing Wall Street corporate raider Gordon Gekko—stands in front of a group of shareholders at Teldar Paper and announces, “Greed is good.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p02">Teldar has been losing money, but the company, Douglas believes, is fundamentally strong. The problem’s the management; it’s the CEO and chief operations officer and all their various vice presidents. Because they don’t actually own the company, they only run it, they’re tempted to use the giant corporation to make their lives comfortable instead of winning profits for the actual owners, the shareholders. As one of those shareholders, Douglas is proposing a revolt: get rid of the lazy executives and put in some new directors (like Douglas’s friends) who actually want to make money. Here’s the pitch. Douglas points at the CEO and the rest of the management team up at their table:</p>
            <span class="blockquote" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_bl01">
                <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p03">All together, these men sitting up here own less than 3 percent of the company. And where does the CEO put his million-dollar salary? Not in Teldar stock; he owns less than 1 percent.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p04">Dramatic pause. Douglas earnestly faces his fellow shareholders.</p>
            <span class="blockquote" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_bl02">
                <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p05">You own the company. That’s right—you, the stockholder. And you’re all being royally screwed over by these bureaucrats with their steak lunches, their hunting and fishing trips, their corporate jets and golden parachutes. Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents, each earning over 200 thousand dollars a year. Now, I have spent the last two months analyzing what all these guys do, and I still can’t figure it out. One thing I do know is that our paper company lost 110 million dollars last year. The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be survival of the unfittest. Well, in my book you either do it right or you get eliminated.</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="para">Douglas says, “In my book you either do it right or you get eliminated.”</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_l02">
                        <li>In economic terms, what does “do it right” mean?</li>
                        <li>In <em class="emphasis">ethical</em> terms, and with reference to a marketplace morality resembling the one Milton Friedman proposes, what does “do it right” mean?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The structure of most large, publicly held corporations separates owners from actual managers who are hired to run the company. They’re employed agents of the owners. What does that mean as far as their ethical obligations go with respect to the <em class="emphasis">purpose</em> of the company they are leading?</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">In the real world, the paper company Weyerhaeuser promotes itself as socially and environmentally responsible. On their web page, they note that they log the wood for their paper from certified forests at a percentage well above that required by law.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn13_010">“Forest Certification,” Weyerhaeuser, accessed June 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/Sustainability/Footprint/Certification">http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/Sustainability/Footprint/Certification</a>.</span> Carefully defining a “certified forest” would require pages, but basically the publicly held corporation is saying that they don’t just buy land, clear-cut everything, and then move on. Instead, and at a cost to themselves, they leave some trees uncut and plant others to ensure that the forest they’re cutting retains its character.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_l03">
                        <li>How could Douglas’s speech at Teldar be rewritten as a criticism of the management at Weyerhaeuser?</li>
                        <li>What specific criticism would Douglas launch at Weyerhaeuser managers who spend corporate money planting trees?</li>
                        <li>If it turned out that the sustainable forest initiative cost Weyerhaeuser some money up front, but ultimately won them positive publicity and consequently more consumers, would Douglas approve of the practice? Explain.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>One broad argument against the various ideas of corporate social and environmental responsibility is that corporations can’t have moral responsibilities at all. How could that argument be specified in the case of Weyerhaeuser?</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">According to the Weyerhaeuser web page, the US government sets certain rules for sustainability with respect to forests. Weyerhaeuser complies and then goes well beyond those requirements. According to Milton Friedman and the ideals of marketplace responsibility, broad questions about social and environmental corporate responsibilities should be answered by democratically elected governments because that’s the institution we’ve developed to manage our ethical life. Governments should try to succeed in the ethical realm by making good laws; companies should try to succeed in the economic realm by making good profits.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_l04">
                        <li>Weyerhaeuser notes on its web page that in China and Uruguay it obeys local regulations with respect to logging. Apparently, however, the company isn’t doing quite as much in those places to avoid the environmental problem of deforestation. Land is very inexpensive in vast, poor nations like these two, and it looks like Weyerhaeuser more or less does what’s required and that’s it. Maybe the company simply buys acres, cuts them, and moves on. Make the case that <em class="emphasis">in ethical terms</em>, the corporate actions in Uruguay and China are more respectable than the actions here in the States.</li>

                    <p class="para">The first part of Douglas’s speech concerned problems with the corporate organization’s structure, and with out-of-control managers: people employed to run a company who promptly forget who their bosses are. The speech’s second part is about what drives life in the business world:</p>
                    <span class="blockquote" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_bl04">
                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p08">The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed—for lack of a better word—is good.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p09">Greed is right.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p10">Greed works.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p12">Greed, in all of its forms—greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge—has marked the upward surge of mankind.</p>
                    </span>
                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch13_s05_s04_p13"><em class="emphasis">Greed</em>, Douglas says, is an imperfect word for what he’s describing. What words might have been better? What words might advocates of marketplace ethics propose?</p>
                </li>
                <li>One word that might have worked better than greed is ambition. Whether the word is greed or ambition, it has, according to the Douglas character, marked the upward surge of mankind. Assume that’s true. Can you speculate about how the upward surge would play out in a developing nation like Uruguay when a multinational comes to town, brings money, creates jobs, and wrecks the forests?</li>
