Things weren’t going well, though, as she tries to break into the industry. One thing she notices is that there aren’t a lot of female fashion designers out there—Vera Wang, Betsey Johnson, and a few more. Not many. So she starts trying to figure it out with questions like these:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s01_l01">
                <li>Do women want straight guy designers to dress them because they dress to please the men? It could make sense: what that designer likes, the man in her life is going to love too.</li>
                <li>Do women prefer gay men to dress them because gay men are their new girlfriends? Gay men are usually more receptive to trends and physical appearances too.</li>
                <li>Do women prefer women designers because she knows a woman’s body better?</li>
                <li>Do men have the same issue? Do some men prefer a lesbian designer? Would they balk at being dressed by a gay designer?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn08_027">“Sexual Orientation in the Fashion Industry,” <em class="emphasis">Love This!</em> (blog), accessed May 24, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://lovethis.wordpress.com/2007/07/28/sexual-orientation-in-the-fashion-industry">http://lovethis.wordpress.com/2007/07/28/sexual-orientation-in-the-fashion-industry</a>.</span>

                <li>Assume MJ is right when she hypothesizes that most women like straight male designers because straight guys are the ones they’re trying to impress, so they want clothes straight guys like. Now imagine you’ve been put in charge of a new line of women’s clothes. Your number one task: sales success. You’ve got five applicants for the job of designing the line. Of course you could just ask them all about their sexual orientation(s), but that might leave you open to a discrimination lawsuit. So could you devise a test for new applicants that’s fair—that gives everyone an equal chance—but still meets your requirement of finding someone who produces clothes that straight guys get excited about?</li>

                </li>
                <li>MJ wonders whether women might prefer women designers because she knows a woman’s body better. Is there a bona fide occupational qualification for a women’s fashion company to hire only women designers? Is there a difference between a BFOQ based on sex and one based on sexual orientation?</li>
                <li>MJ asks, “Do women prefer gay men to dress them because gay men are their new girlfriends?” Assume you think there’s something to this. Could you design a few behavioral interview questions that test the applicants’ ability to become girlfriends (in the sense that MJ means it) with their clients? Would these be ethically acceptable interviews, or do you believe there’s something wrong and unfair about them?</li>

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s03_p02">This is a significant problem in the Dominican Republic, which produces excellent baseball players but little in the way of reliable paperwork proving who people really are and when they were born. The Cleveland Indians learned all about that when they gave a $575,000 bonus to a seventeen-year-old Dominican named Jose Ozoria, only to later find out he was actually a twenty-year-old named Wally Bryan.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s03_p03">This and similar cases of misidentification explain why baseball teams are starting to apply genetic tests to the prospects they’re scouting. Typically, the player is invited to provide a DNA sample from himself and his parents to confirm that he’s no older than he claims. The player pays for the test and is reimbursed if the results show he was telling the truth.</p>

She is, it turns out, neither a woman nor a man; she’s a hermaphrodite: a little bit of both.

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_p01">Goldman Sachs is an expansive financial services company. Many clients are institutional: private companies and government organizations wanting to raise cash seek Goldman’s help in packaging and then selling stock or bonds. On the other side, private investors—wealthy individuals wanting to multiply their riches—receive a hearty welcome at Goldman because they have the cash to purchase those stocks and bonds. Ultimately, Goldman Sachs is a hub where large companies, governmental powers, and wealthy people come and do business together.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_p02">Executives at Goldman Sachs are among the world’s highest paid. According to a <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> article, “At the center of Goldman’s lucrative compensation program is the partnership. Goldman’s partners are its highest executives and its biggest stars. Yet while Goldman is required to report compensation for its top officers, it releases very little information about this broader group, remaining tightlipped about even basic information like who is currently a partner.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn08_032">Susanne Craig and Eric Dash, “Study Points to Windfall for Goldman Partners,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 18, 2011, accessed May 24, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/study-points-to-windfall-for-goldman-partners/?hp">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/study-points-to-windfall-for-goldman-partners/?hp</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_p03">The rest of the article investigates this shadowy partnership. The conclusions: “Goldman has almost 860 current and former partners. In the last 12 years, they have cashed out more than $20 billion in Goldman shares and currently hold more than $10 billion in Goldman stock.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_p04">This tally of accumulated wealth in Goldman stock doesn’t even include the standard salary and cash bonuses the partners receive, but leaving that aside, here’s the math: $30 billion divided by 860 divided by 12 should give some sense of the wealth each of these corporate stars is accumulating over the course of a year. To give a provisional idea of how large the number of dollars is here, when you try plugging $30 billion into an iPhone calculator, you find the screen can’t even hold a number that long. Using a different calculator yields this result: $2.9 million per partner every year.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_p05">The 2.9 million can be compared with the salary earned by the average American: $50,000 a year. The Goldman partner gets that in less than a week. This huge money explains the clawing fight that goes on inside Goldman to become a partner. The odds are long. Each time the books are opened to admit a new class, only 1 of 330 Goldman employees makes the cut. It is, in the words of one former partner, “a very Darwinian, survival-of-the-fittest firm.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_p06">In the public comments section of the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> story about Goldman, a person identified as GHP picks up on the firm’s characterization as a “Darwinian, survival-of-the-fittest” place. He wrote, “The French revolution was also very Darwinian, let’s give that a try.” During the French Revolution, the wealthy and powerful were rewarded with a trip to the guillotine.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_p07">Probably, GHP isn’t just annoyed about how much money executives at Goldman make, he, like a lot of people, is peeved by the fact that the company was bailed out by the federal government during the 2008–9 financial crisis. Had the taxpayers (people making $50,000) not kicked in, Goldman might’ve gone bankrupt, and all that money its partners accumulated in stock would’ve vanished. As it happens, the US government’s bailout was masterminded by US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. His previous job was CEO (and partner) at Goldman.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Questions</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_l01">
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Goldman is dominated by a “Darwinian, survival-of-the-fittest” mentality. What does that mean?</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_l02">
                        <li>In ethical terms, how can this mentality be justified?</li>
                        <li>Would a company dominated by this mentality, whether it’s Goldman or not, be more likely to announce job openings to a limited public, or as a massive public announcement? Why?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Describe the advantages of a “behavioral interview.” If you were in charge of hiring for a company seeking employees who flourish in a survival-of-the-fittest environment, what kind of question might you ask in a behavioral interview? Why?</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">One contributor to the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> comments section writes, “There are sure to be lots of pointed, angry posts about how unfair it is that these guys make so much money etc. But if we are honest, there is a fair amount of envy and pure remorse that we weren’t bright enough to go down that path! And these guys are very bright.”</p>
                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_p08">How could these comments be construed to explain why high wages and big bonuses are used by Goldman to motivate its workers? What is it that makes big money (or the possibility of big money) function as a powerful motivator to encourage employees to work hard and well? Ethically, how can this use of big money be justified?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">One difference between offering an employee a wage increase and offering a bonus is that the latter doesn’t come automatically the next year. The employee has to earn it from scratch all over again.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s04_l03">
                        <li>Why might managers at Goldman award their best workers with a bonus instead of a wage increase?</li>
                        <li>By appeal to an ethical theory, could you make the case that, in general, employees should be paid mainly through a bonus system? How would the theory work at two extremes: wealthy Goldman executives and waitresses at a corner diner?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Given the kind of work that’s done at Goldman—bringing wealthy people and powerful organizations together to make deals—why might party aptitude (the ability to mix socially after hours) be considered when deciding who does and who doesn’t make partner at Goldman? How could that decision be justified ethically? How could it be criticized ethically?</li>
                <li>Make the case that in theoretical terms, managers at Goldman have an ethical responsibility to institute the process of rank and yank.</li>

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s05_p01">A <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> story about firing employees relates that some companies use “the surgical method: terminations that last about 15 seconds, after which former employees are ushered off company property.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn08_033">Eli Saslow, “The Art of Letting Employees Go,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, August 9, 2009, accessed May 24, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/08/AR2009080802659.html?hpid=topnews">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/08/AR2009080802659.html?hpid=topnews</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s05_p02">It doesn’t have to be that way, though. For about $2,000 per fired employee, the outplacement company Five O’Clock Club will help employers manage the actual termination moment more compassionately. Later on, the fired worker receives a year of career coaching to help get back on track.</p>
            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s05_p03">What does the Five O’Clock Club recommend managers do at the critical moment when giving the bad news? To answer, according to the <em class="emphasis">Post</em>, they offer a booklet titled <em class="emphasis">How to Terminate Employees While Respecting Human Dignity</em>, which “asks managers to approach layoffs with the understanding that, ‘unlike facilities and equipment, humans have an intrinsic worth beyond their contribution to the organization.’”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn08_034">Eli Saslow, “The Art of Letting Employees Go,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, August 9, 2009, accessed May 24, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/08/AR2009080802659.html?hpid=topnews">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/08/AR2009080802659.html?hpid=topnews</a>.</span></p>

                <li>I know this is hard, but you’ll get back on your feet.</li>

            <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s05_p06">In sum, the Five O’Clock Club helps workers feel better when they’re fired, and helps them get on with their lives. Meanwhile, employers get a hedge against lawsuits. The outplacement service, according to the Five O’Clock Club literature, “can redirect anger or anxiety away from the organization and…encourage the newly-fired to sign their severance agreements so they can get on with their lives.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-brusseau-fn08_037">Eli Saslow, “The Art of Letting Employees Go,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, August 9, 2009, accessed May 24, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/08/AR2009080802659.html?hpid=topnews">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/08/AR2009080802659.html?hpid=topnews</a>.</span></p>

                <li>
                    <p class="para">The Five O’Clock Club charges $2,000 per firing. If you were fired, would you prefer to receive the compassionate end the Five O’Clock Club provides, or just get shown the door but also get to keep that $2,000 for yourself?</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s05_l04">
                        <li>If you’re the boss, do you have the right to decide this for the fired employee? Why or why not?</li>

                        <li>Does this sound like utilitarian ethical thinking to you, or is it more in line with the notion of an ethics guided by basic duties and rights? Why?</li>
                        <li>Probably, everyone agrees that humans aren’t just machines that can be installed and replaced. But can an ethical argument be made to <em class="emphasis">treat people in the workplace as machines</em>—that is, to abruptly hire them when they’re useful and fire them when they’re not? What ethical theory (or theories) could help you make the case?</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <p class="para">In general terms, here are three firing situations:</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s05_l06">
                        <li>an economic downturn (good workers are sacked because the company can’t afford to keep them)</li>
                        <li>rank and yank (workers are fulfilling their duties but not as well as most of the others)</li>
                        <li>misbehavior (a worker is fired directly because of something done or not done)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s05_p07">Looking at these three contexts and the Five O’Clock Club, do you think their services should be hired in all three situations? Do the ethics of firing change depending on <em class="emphasis">why</em> the person is being fired? Explain.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Recall some of the Five O’Clock Club’s prepacked firing sentences:</p>

                    <p class="para" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s05_p08">The contrasting method of firing employees—the surgical method—is to look the person in the eye, say you’re fired, and have security march the ex-employee out the door, all in less than a minute.</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="brusseau-ch08_s05_s05_l08">
                        <li>Is it possible to make the case that the surgical method is actually more compassionate and respectful?</li>
                        <li>Is there a place for compassion in business? From a manager’s perspective, how should compassion be defined within a business context?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Maybe the Five O’Clock Club gets hired because a company really wants to help and support fired employees. <em class="emphasis">Or</em> maybe the company doesn’t really care about them; all they want is to avoid wrongful termination lawsuits.
